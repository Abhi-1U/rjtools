This is a new submission, with changes made in response to initial checks by CRAN (Benjamin Altmann).

Primarily functions no longer write to file by default. 

Note that this package is used by article authors for the R Journal. The first step is to create a template article to populate. Thus it is not realistic to have lots of example code, as requested by Benjamin, and so we have not made any changes to examples.
